					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Zack Jacobson-Weaver is currently a PhD at Colorado University’s ATLAS Institute asking, “How can open-source empower every willing to teacher become a ‘public school’?”. He explores the true, grassroots maker movement and its utilization of open-source hardware and software as the catalyst for anti-standardized, anti-disciplinary post-public education. Most recently, he taught digital fabrication and interaction design at the School of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, USA. While there as part of the ‘Human-Machine Virtuosity’ research group in robotic and interactive fabrication, Zack applied open-source sensibility to the development of a ‘Universal Peripheral Adaptor’, to encourage collaboration and open tools within this small community. Zack is a graduate of Carnegie Mellon’s Master of Tangible Interaction Design and the University of Michigan School of Art and Design. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Nadya Peek is a PhD student at the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms, where they work at the intersection between physical science and digital science. Nadya Peek works on unconventional digital fabrication tools, small scale automation, networked control systems, and advanced manufacturing. Nadya Peek is also an active member of the fablab community, working on making digital fabrication more accessible with better cad/cam tools and developing open source (hardware) machines and control systems. The machines from the machines that make project are designed to be made using the tools available in fablabs, helping users take digital fabrication home. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Liat Brix-Etgar is an architect, researcher and lecturer. She is the head and the initiator of “Civil Architecture” Research Unit in the Department of Architecture in Bezalel Academy for Arts and Design, Jerusalem. The unit interlaces design studio, political theory, planning and activism. It seeks to develop collaborative, open and deeply inclusive civil infrastructure, capacities and practices that would push towards democratizing planning processes. Liat received her B.Arch degree from the Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem and her M.A in philosophy (summa cum lauda) from the Tel Aviv University where she wrote her thesis about “The Spatial-Political Lexicon of Jean Luc Nancy”. She is an architect and associate in Tehiru Group in Tel Aviv. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Hagit Keysar’s work brings together theory, activism and art practices, she is currently a PhD candidate at the Politics and Government department in Ben Gurion University, Israel, and since 2011 she takes part in the Public Lab’s community of practitioners. Hagit’s research concerns open-source, citizen-driven map-making technologies in Jerusalem. One piece at a time, she explores the political implications of collaborative technologies and do-it-yourself practices in spaces of conflict and civil inequality. Through long-term collaborative work with residents in the city she seeks to develop tools-in-context that would intervene in the shaping of our geographic imaginary, engaging people in exposing the invisible through critical seeing and doing. Hagit holds a Masters degree in Visual Anthropology from the University of Manchester (UK) and a BA in Fine Arts from the Bezalel Academy for Arts and Design, Jerusalem. [&#8230;]]]></description>
